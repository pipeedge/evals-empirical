# To conduct a large-scale analysis of practitioner-generated content from sources like blogs, forums, and reports, you can employ an automated research method known as a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR). This approach systematically gathers and analyzes information from both formal academic papers and informal "grey literature" to capture timely, practice-based evidence.   

# Here is a guide on how you can automate this research process:

## Step 1: Define Scope and Keywords
Before you begin, clearly define your research questions and a comprehensive set of search terms. This ensures your automated search is targeted and effective. The keywords should include variations to maximize the retrieval of relevant documents.   

Research Questions: 
- RQ1: What are the key challenges practitioners face when designing, implementing, and using AI/LLM evaluation frameworks?

- RQ2: What are the key requirements and desired features practitioners articulate for next-generation AI/LLM evaluation frameworks and tools?

- RQ3: How can these challenges and requirements be synthesized into a conceptual workflow to guide the integration of evaluation into the AI/LLM development lifecycle?

Keywords: Develop a list of keywords and their synonyms (e.g., "LLM evaluation," "model testing," "RAG assessment," "agent benchmarking").   

## Step 2: Automated Data Collection and Scraping
This phase involves using scripts, typically written in Python, to automatically gather data from your target sources (text only, do not use video resources).

- Developer and Community Forums (GitHub, Stack Overflow, Hugging Face): You can use the official APIs provided by these platforms to systematically collect data. For instance, you can search for issues, discussions, and code repositories on GitHub related to LLM evaluation frameworks. On Stack Overflow, you can filter questions by specific tags (e.g., [llm], [evaluation]) and criteria like upvote counts to ensure the quality and relevance of the posts.   

- Blogs, White Papers, and Reports: A custom web scraper can be developed to crawl and download articles from targeted websites, such as technology blogs, company publications, and industry news outlets.

Data Filtering and Preprocessing
Once you have collected the raw data, you need to clean and filter it to create a high-quality dataset for analysis. This can also be automated.

- Initial Filtering: Apply inclusion and exclusion criteria based on the metadata you collected. For example, you can filter articles and discussions by title or description to remove irrelevant content like product advertisements or announcements.   

- Content Cleaning: Programmatically remove duplicates, HTML tags, and other noise from the text. For transcribed content, you may need to run scripts to correct common transcription errors and add punctuation to improve readability.   

- Final Selection: Create a script to apply your final selection criteria. For instance, you might only include Stack Overflow questions with an accepted answer or GitHub issues that are closed and have substantial discussion.   

## a module for Thematic Analysis
Semi-Automated Thematic Analysis
With a clean dataset, you can use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform a semi-automated thematic analysis to identify recurring patterns and themes.   

- Import into Analysis Software: Import the cleaned text data into a qualitative data analysis tool. These tools can help you manage large volumes of text and assist in the coding process.   


- Automated Keyword and Topic Extraction:
Frequency Analysis: Run scripts to identify the most frequently used terms and phrases to get a high-level overview of key topics.

Topic Modeling: Use algorithms like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to automatically group words into topics, which can help you discover underlying themes in the data, such as "integration challenges," "data quality," or "human-in-the-loop."

- Coding and Theme Development: While initial coding often requires human judgment to assign descriptive labels to text segments, software can help you efficiently search, group, and organize these codes into broader themes. For example, codes like "time-consuming scans," "manual effort," and "pipeline integration difficulty" can be grouped under a theme like "Functional and Integration Barriers".
